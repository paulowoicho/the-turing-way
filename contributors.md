# Record of Contributions

*The `contributors.md` file and the contributors table in the `README file` together form the record of contributions in _The Turing Way_.*

Contributions to _The Turing Way_ may include but are not limited to, bug fixing, chapter planning, writing, editing, reviewing, idea generation, presentation, project management, and maintenance.
We recognise all these contributions and acknowledge our community members fairly.
For example, using [all contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org) we update the contributors table with each person's name, where the emoji keys indicate the different tasks they have done (see the [README file](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/README.md#contributors)).
We understand that different contributions mean different things to people and may translate differently towards their personal interest, skill development, value exchange and advancement of their careers.
Therefore, we also offer the [contributors.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/contributors.md) file as a dedicated location to capture personal highlights from _The Turing Way_ community members.

Individual contributors are welcome to provide their details under the section "Personal Highlights from _The Turing Way_ Contributors".

### Kirstie Whitaker

* Role: **Project lead**
* GitHub id: [kirstiejane](http://github.com/kirstiejane)
* ORCID: [0000-0001-8498-4059](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8498-4059)
* Short bio:
> I'm the lead of Tools, Practices and Systems research Programme at the Alan Turing Institute.
I have a PhD in Neuroscience from the University of California at Berkeley and conducted my postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in the Brain Mapping Unit.
I am a Mozilla fellowship (2016) and Fulbright scholarship (2007) alumna.

* Personal highlights:
> I am the lead of _The Turing Way_.
> I've done a lot of advocacy for changing research culture to make our work more efficient and effective, and I've noticed that we need to address the power structures in academia if we are to truly make research reproducible by default.
> I'm excited to build the Turing Way to both inspire the people who DO the research to make all their outputs as accessible as possible, and to nudge everyone else in the ecosystem to care about the work required to do so.

* More information:
> I'm really passionate about the concept of making science "open for all".
> I take that to mean we should share all of our outputs - the data, code and protocols that we develop - whether they're "significant" or not.
> But it also includes making those outputs FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. I am an advocate for greater diversity in STEM and in data science and particularly passionate about improving the ways we reward collaborative and supportive working.
> Finally, I'd like to pivot to having data science project be developed in the open from the beginning and with a decision making governance processs that is inclusive and community-lead.

**Contributors names should be added alphabetically**

### Alexander Morley

* Role: Infrastructure Maintainer (2018 - 2019)
* GitHub id: [alexmorley](http://github.com/alexmorley)
* ORCID: [TBA](https://orcid.org/TBA)
* Short bio:
> I am a Mozilla Fellow (2018-) and a PhD Candidate at the MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit at the University of Oxford (2015-).
> I also receive support from the Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship programme (2018) and Microsoft/Research Software England Cloud Computing Fellowship programme (2018).
> My undergraduate degree was in Medicine at the University of Oxford (2012-2015).

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I really want research to be accessible, but in a much broader sense than the word is often used. I would love to see a world where re-mixing research is a common thing, whether that be re-mixing figures to make them easier to understand, re-using data to generate new insights, or testing new methods to see how our theories might need to change.
> Slightly less on topic, but just as important, I am also passionate about the development and adoption of best-practices in governance. Safe and inclusive spaces are all too rare in acedemia, and I think some part of that can be solved by doing away with our laissez-faire attitude towards governance and management.

**Why do you care about the Turing Way?**

> When people don't use best practices in data science its almost always because they either don't know about them, or feel they don't have time. Advocates will tell people that the time is saved in the long-term, but it's a hard sell.
> By providing concrete, incremental, but authoratitve, guidance I believe the Turing Way could provide the nudge that allows people to realise the benefits for themselves, and lowers the barrier for more researchers to acquire these highly valued skills.


### Anna Krystalli

> I’m also an editor for rOpenSci, a community of users and developers, Creating technical infrastructure of peer-reviewed R software tools for working with scientific data sources on the web.

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I care about reproducible research in R!
> I learnt to code during my PhD in Marine Macroecology and was instantly hooked.
> Building on past experience as a quality assurance auditor, my experiences made me interested in how we practice science and specifically how we can do more out of the real workhorses of modern research, our code and data.
> Working in _The Turing Way_ is a fantastic opportunity to take stock of the great work that has already been done in this space, aggregate and distill it to templates, checklists and  best practices guidelines that are immediately useful to researchers.
> It’s an opportunity to set standards and harness the power of convention, especially with ECRs that have an opportunity to set up good practices from the start! Indeed, I hope the Turing Way will very much become the “Sheffield Way” too!

### Becky Arnold

* Role: Core Contributor (2018 - 2019)
* GitHub id: [r-j-arnold](http://github.com/r-j-arnold)
* ORCID: [0000-0003-0355-0617](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0355-0617)
* Short bio:
> I'm an astrophysics PhD student at the University of Sheffield and I do computer simulations of star forming regions.
> I'm a 2018 Software Sustainability Institute fellow using the funds to organise talks and workshops about various issues surrounding good programming practise.

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I am passionate about Science.
> All over the world humans come together to try and figure out how the universe works and that's *amazing*, just as amazing as the answers themselves.
> I'm also passionate about how we actually do that science, making sure it's accurate and reproducible.
> If it isn't both of those things we haven't moved forwards much, or worse still end up going in circles.
> I care deeply about changing the culture of academia, in which abuse of power (both minor and major) is all too common.
> I've met so many people that want to code well and follow best practise, which will benefit science enormously, but struggle to know how to do so.
> While there are lots of fantastic resources out there they're often scattered and _The Turing Way_ can improve that.
I also hope that it can convince people that don't consider themselves capable of being good programmers that there are steps they can take to drastically improve their coding.

### Camila Rangel Smith

* Role: Translation Lead - Spanish (2020)
* GitHub id: [crangelsmith](https://github.com/crangelsmith)
* ORCID id: [0000-0002-0227-836X](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0227-836X)
* Short bio:
> I am a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute. I hold a PhD in Particle Physics from Université Paris Diderot where I worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
> During my PhD I participated on the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle announced by CERN in 2012.
> I continued working on ATLAS as a postdoc with Uppsala University where I focused on searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.
> Right before joining the Turing, I worked as Data Scientist in the EdTech sector developing innovative products focused on the assessment process in education.
> Currently I’m working in collaboration with researchers from the Global Systems Institute at University of Exeter called Data science for Sustainable Development.
> In this project we are using remote sensing to monitor the resilience of patterned vegetation from semi-arid dryland ecosystems in the Sahel.

* Personal highlights

> I think The Turing Way is an excellent resource that can change the way science is done (I wish I had it when I started my PhD!).
> Although the international language of science is English, I know for a fact that not everyone in places like Latin-American have the time and resources to learn it, so I think we must do everything we can to break those barriers and improve the accessibility of knowledge for everyone.
> This is my motivation to translate the book to Spanish, and I hope that the Spanish version will be used as an important resource on the master course we are developing in  LA-CoNGA physics project.

* More information

> I’m from Venezuela, and although I have done most of my career in Europe I’ve been always keen to stay connected to the academic and scientific wold back in Latin-America.
> I’m the co-founder of the CEVALE2VE project (http://www.cevale2ve.org/en/home/), which of a virtual learning community that aims to tackle the serious issue of brain-drain in some Latin-American countries by bringing back the knowledge in a digital/online platform.
> More recently that project has become consolidated into LA-CoNGA physics (http://laconga.redclara.net/), an EU Erasmus+ funded project with a mission to create a Latin American and European Community for Advanced Physics.
> In this project I’m helping to build a data science module that will be thought in an online master course.

### Heidi Seibold

* Role: Core contributor (2020)
* GitHub id: [HeidiSeibold](https://github.com/HeidiSeibold)
* ORCID id: [0000-0002-8960-9642](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8960-9642)
* Short bio:
> I lead a group on Open AI in Health at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munich.
I develop machine learning methods to figure out which patients react well to certain treatments and implements these methods in R.
> My passion for open and reproducible research has led me to join the Turing Way community. I am involved in meta-research projects (research about research), I support, teach and contribute to open projects such as The Turing Way.
> My work for the *Journal of Statistical Software* includes reproducibility checks. We only publish papers which are fully computationally reproducible. I also work on making our machine-learning software more user-friendly, reusable and extensible. Together with a PhD student I am thinking about how to
use data from hospitals to help doctors and patients find the right treatment
for each individual patient.

* Personal highlights:

> I work in data science and open and reproducible research are the things I think and
care about the most. So to me it only made sense to get involved. Plus: the community seemed
amazing!
> To me The Turing Way is a role model when it comes to collaborative,
distributed work. I learned so much just by participating in the book sprint
and seeing how Malvika, Kirstie and everyone else contributed to providing an
extremely welcoming and at the same time productive space. I took what
I learned and tried to apply it in other contexts such as teaching. I will
continue to do so.
> The Turing Way also inspired me to think about new ways we could teach people
about open and reproducible (data) science. I am currently thinking a lot about
how we could use the content from The Turing Way and turn it into a course.
This idea was also part of an application, where I proposed to start a new
group on *Open AI*.
> I regularly recommend The Turing Way as a resource. Both for learning more
about reproducible data science and also when discussing specific topics.
I think that people are taking it on and reading it :)

* More information:
> First, I would like to continue to help create content, review others content
and be helpful in any way I can. Sometimes I like to look at really old issues
and pull requests for example. Reviving such old, often almost finished bits,
is very rewarding.
> Apart from that I also have a bigger, long term idea for The Turing Way.
I personally am not a huge fan of reading. So books are not my favorite way to
learn.  In the past years I learned a lot by listening to others in talks,
podcasts, videos, and of course conversations.  So for me it is only a natural
next step for The Turing Way to become more than a book. It could be an
ecosystem, with the book at its basis. And -- if we decide to go that route --
I would like to be a part of it.

* GitHub id: [Laura Carter](https://github.com/LauraCarter)
* ORCID: [0000-0002-4285-1140](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4285-1140)
* Short bio:
> I'm a PhD candidate in the Human Rights Centre at the University of Essex, UK, researching the human rights implications of the use of data-driven technologies in the UK public sector, focusing on gender stereotyping and gender discrimination. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a human rights researcher for almost a decade, specialising mostly in human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity. I carried out field research in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa covering topics including homophobic and transphobic hate crimes, criminalisation of homosexuality and of sex work, legal gender recognition for trans people, and health rights for intersex people.

* Personal highlights:
> I'm really enjoying learning more about Open Science practices and communities! I'm excited to be part of an [OLS-2](https://openlifesci.org/) mentee cohort alongside [Ismael Kherroubi Garcia](https://github.com/Ismael-KG) and [Sophia Batchelor](https://github.com/BrainonSilicon), working on the _Guide to Ethical Research_: if you're interested in building a community of thoughtful, reflective, ethical data scientists, please come and join us!

### Louise Bowler

* Role: Core Contributor (2019)
* GitHub id: [LouiseABowler](http://github.com/LouiseABowler)
* ORCID: [0000-0002-4910-9205](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4910-9205)
* Short bio:
> I’m a Research Data Scientist in the Alan Turing Institute’s Research Engineering Group.
> I have a degree in Physics from Imperial College London, after which I joined the Life Sciences Interface Doctoral Training Centre at the University of Oxford.
> I worked on an interdisciplinary PhD project that combined mathematical modelling, cardiac electrophysiology and safety pharmacology, and moved over to the Turing afterwards.
> Since then, I’ve worked on a range of projects spanning synthetic data, data visualisation, and of course, the Turing Way!

* Personal highlights:
> I got involved with _The Turing Way_ via case studies of reproducibility in academic projects - essentially, I was a reproducibility detective during the initial phase of the project! :female_detective: The Turing Way was my first experience of working with collaborators from so many different institutions, and the community around this project has been a real highlight for me. My official time on the Turing Way has come to an end, but I still enjoy keeping in touch through the Book Dashes and other events.

* More information:
> As scientists, we share our work via papers and talks, but the intricacies of precisely *how* we implement an analysis pipeline or novel algorithm can be very difficult to convey in those formats.
> We're currently seeing changes in the default way we want to publish our papers through the open access movement, and I'd love to see a similar change in mindset happen about the data that we collect and the code that we develop so that others can reproduce, learn from and build upon our work.
> I want to ensure that the route to sharing these types of research output is open to everyone, regardless of their level of programming experience - the route might not always be straightforward, but it's a great opportunity to share and learn from our experiences!
> So many research projects now contain computational elements, yet it is easy to forget that not everyone has access to training in software engineering, or has a group of colleagues with such interests.
> If we say that we want people to make their research open and reproducible, we need to give them the tools they need to be confident in doing so.
> I see the Turing Way as the means of bridging that gap, by providing a friendly, practical and helpful guide for researchers at all stages of their careers.

### Martin O'Reilly

* Role: Core Contributor (2019)
* GitHub id: [martintoreilly](http://github.com/martintoreilly)
* ORCID: [TBA](https://orcid.org/TBA)
* Short bio:
> I'm Principal Research Software Engineer and Deputy Head of the Research Engineering Group at the Alan Turing Institute.
> My focus is on using good software engineering practices to increase the impact of research software by making it reusable, reliable and robust
> I also have a strong interest in reproducible research, and am working to improve the tools and working practices at the Turing to make it easier for our researchers to work reproducibly
> I've moved back and forth between industry and academia over the years, gaining an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience along the way.

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I feel strongly that researchers have a responsibility to ensure that the outcomes of their research are made available to all - researchers, practitioners and the public.
> These outcomes should be made available in a way that allows others not just to reproduce them, but also to re-use and build upon them.
> An awful lot of researcher and practitioner time is spent getting to the point they can usefully evaluate whether some research is of use to them, or in re-discovering unpublished negative results.
> This seems extremely wasteful and I'm convinced we can and should do better.
> In particular, I feel a lot can be done to improve the effective re-use of data produced by research projects.
> While there has been significant progress in recent years in the amount of data published alongside research articles, there is still a wide gulf between open data and re-usable data.
> In terms of research areas, I'm fascinated by the brain and especially the approach of understanding the brain by "faking it" (i.e. modelling and simulation).
> I'm particularly interested in robots as a way of embodying these models in the real world.
> I believe the Turing Way can impact positively in both these areas.
> By providing recommended working practices and guidance on associated tooling, we can make it easy for researchers to do the right thing.
> By publishing this with the weight of the Turing brand, we can apply social pressure for the adoption of these practices as new norms in the research communities we operate in.

* Personal highlights:
> Working on the Turing Way reminded me about what I value in my work and that I do have more technical skill than I think.
> Based on the Turing Way work, I have started the product managmement role for DMPonline and I'm trying to take the inspiration from the project into my every day work whenever I can.

* More information:
> As a librarian, it feels like our influence is often limited, but I try to set up workshops/events to at least get the discussion started and give especially PhD students the feeling that they can challenge the status quo and there will be people in the institution that will support them that might not be their supervisor.
> I really love how the Turing Way aims to create good examples and I hope we can develop some ideas and resources that can have a positive impact in changing the current system.
> I care about collaborating and get really excited about trying new tools if my limited tech skills allow.

* ORCID: [0000-0001-5329-7168](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5329-7168)
* Short bio:
> I am a Research Data Librarian at the University of Manchester, co-leading the research data management support service.
> My focus is on data sharing, training and encouraging researchers to engage in Open Research.
> My background is in the social sciences and I have recently started a PhD with the British Library and the University of Sheffield looking at Open Access and the role of the National Library.

* Personal highlights:
> `TBA`

* More information:
> I am passionate about Supporting researchers! Making it as easy as possible for researchers to make their research reproducible and open, and for this to be easier than undertaking research in a closed manner.
> I try to help researchers make small improvements in making their research open, on the basis that some progress is better than none!
> Working in research data management I'm naturally concerned that data is not taken seriously as an independent research output and the reward system in academia is so heavily geared towards 'high impact' journal articles.
> As someone from a non-STEM background I'm also interested in how we can make reproducible research as accessible as possible. This will be the first project where I've worked directly in GitHub and I'm excited to get more confident in using it!
> I spend much of my time talking to researchers about the overarching principles of *why* reproducible and open research is a good idea and am excited by the idea of giving people practical guidance on *how* to do this.
> Messy code is frequently cited in these discussions as a reason for not sharing code so if we could produce something which helps people get past this barrier would be great.
> I hope that the Turing Way will be something we can also use at the University of Manchester and other Turing universities around the country!

* ORCID: [0000-0003-2591-9462](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2591-9462)
* Short bio:
> I am the Research Software Community Manager at the Software Sustainability Institute.
> Previously, I worked as a Research Associate and Open Science Champion at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester.
> My research involved observing jets from young stars with next-generation radio telescopes to investigate the physical processes that assemble stars like our Sun, and am currently working to make data from the radio telescope facilities at Jodrell Bank more accessible to all.
> I am also a FOSTER certified Open Science Trainer, Mozilla Open Leader, and Organiser for the women in data meetup group HER+Data MCR.

* Personal highlights:
> I have promoted *The Turing Way* through many presentations, notably at the Open Science Fair 2019 where I presented a poster and delivered 3 demonstrations of the project to attendees, one of which was recorded as part of the [ORION Open Science Podcast](https://orionopenscience.podbean.com/e/the-fair-is-in-town-figshare-the-turing-way-and-open-science-quest-at-the-osfair2019/).
> Through *The Turing Way* project I have gained valuable skills in open project management and met truly inspiring individuals working hard to promote openness and reproducibility in research.

* More information:
> I am passionate about promoting openness, transparency, reproducibility, wellbeing and inclusion in STEM and facilitating cross-stakeholder conversations in order to change research culture for the better.
> I also love space exploration.
> *The Turing Way* goal of ensuring that reproducible data science is "too easy not to do" really resonates with me.
> I find that it can be difficult to get researchers to engage with reproducibility and sharing their research outputs because they perceive that it will take too much time and effort with very little reward - when the opposite is true!
> Ensuring results are reproducible not only benefits research as a whole and increases efficiency, but working this way also offers researchers more opportunities for impact and collaboration.

### Sophia Batchelor

* Role: HacktoberFest contribution facilitator, [OLS project lead](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/open-life-science-mentoring): Ethics Research Framework (2020)
* GitHub id: [BrainonSilicon](https://github.com/BrainonSilicon)
* ORCID: [0000-0002-8572-2058](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8572-2058)
* Short bio:
>I am a PhD student at the University of Leeds studying sensorimotor learning with the Center for Immersive Technologies. My research focuses on understanding how how our brains interprets, and responds to both our physical reality, and a constructed reality (AR/VR). I do this through a deep love of the brain and emerging technologies. We will soon be existing in the future that we are creating now; so when we build with a "people first" (or a brain first) philosophy, we end up building a space that allows people to flourish.


* Personal highlights:
> MY FIRST CONTRIBUTION TO THE TURING WAY! It's an absolute honor to join The Turing Way community as we look towards an open, ethical, and accessible future. After having such a mixed STEM and non-STEM background, I'm thrilled to have joined this community as it grows and guides my thinking about how and what it means to do research.

* More information:
> I'm a fierce advocate for ethical and open research, and those beliefs tend to carry into everything I do. I previously worked on Brain Computer Interfaces after finishing my undergrad at UC Berkeley where I saw the incredible work that can be done through collaborative, crossdisciplinary science. I'm now part of Open Life Science's second cohort learning how to implement the teachings of The Turing Way because when good science and good practice meets, great things can happen.

## Collaborating Organisations

*When members participate in The Turing Way community with the in-kind support of their funders and organisation, we acknowledge each member individually and list their organisations as “Collaborating organisations”.
Such organisational supports are applicable when one or multiple members from a project or community collaborate to build resources in The Turing Way.*

### [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/)

The Netherlands eScience Center is the Dutch national hub for the development and application of domain overarching software and methods for the scientific community. Their main goal is to enable scientists with varying computing experience to fully utilize the potential of the available e-infrastructure and allow them to achieve otherwise unreachable scientific breakthroughs. The Netherlands eScience Center is primarily funded by the national research council (NWO) and the national e-infrastructure organization (SURF) of the Netherlands.

The Netherlands eScience center maintains [its own guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/) for reproducible software development. The focus of the eScience center guide has a big overlap with _The Turing Way_ and therefore it makes sense to avoid duplicating efforts. The eScience center contributes to _The Turing Way_ in the areas which are relevant for the eScience guide. The eScience guide points to _The Turing Way_ in when information would otherwise be duplicated.

Details of each members with their contributions have been listed alphabetically.
